# INF265 Project 3: Sequence Models

This repository contains the code, documentation and report for a deep learning project completed as part of the course INF265: Deep Learning at the University of Bergen. 
The project assignment was completed as a collaboration between [Simon Vedaa](https://github.com/simsam8) and [Sebastian Røkholt](https://github.com/SebastianRokholt). It was handed in on the 3rd of May 2024. 

## Setup

The project was created with Python >3.10. To run and replicate our results, make sure to install the project dependencies. 
For Windows, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
For Linux, run `pip install -r requirements-linux.txt`.

To view and run the notebook, launch Jupyter Notebook with the `jupyter notebook` command in the terminal and simply select the .ipynb file from the directory to open it.

To reproduce our work with identical results, you should set the seed for the randoom state to 265 and train on an Nvidia GPU (CUDA).
